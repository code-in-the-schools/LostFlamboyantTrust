    <h1> About me </h1>
<!-- first paragraph-->
    <p> I love to walk in nature and watch movies. I mostly watch anime and play video games though. People call me adorable and often mistake me for a 16 year old which is pretty cool because that means I look super young, which I still am lol. I speak spanish and english but i'm working on my japanese, mandarin, and arabic.
      I am currently happy because I have met new people and made friends as well as met the love of my life. He likes comics and manga too! I have a squishy brown dog named Weedybee and it's sooooo cute!!! </p>

    <h2> Why app and web development? </h2>
<!-- second paragraph-->
    <p> I personally love video games and aspire to be a game designer. App and web development is cruicial to me because in order to build my assets in game coding I must know how to work well in other aspects. Inaddition to that I could make web or moble games as step building to being a profesional big time game designer. Thats why app and web development is important to me, for work but also for small hobbies for practice. </p>
