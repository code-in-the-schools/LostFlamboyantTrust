     <h2> The Love Of My Life </h2>
<p> He is the cutest person in the world. Whenever I see him he makes my heart pound faster than before. He gives me joy even when he's not even trying. I love him so much. More than he could ever understand. He is brigter than the stars for he is the light in the sky from which I adore. I go to the window to see the stars but I only see him. The galaxy can not compare to his immesnse beauty. Nor can the darkest mood outshine his greatness. His dark curly hair, his smile, his voice, his eyes, his body, his mind so beautiful yet waits to let me in. Like the lone wolf he stands but like most wolves there is always a pack. I will always be with him and always have his back. </p>

     <h3> How we met and fell in love </h3>

<p> We were in a mental hospital. A lot of us young patients are nosey so we wanna see who's coming in. At least to know is it someone who we could talk to. I sneakily watched from the corner of the hallway. I saw a new patient coming in. I had overheard that it was a guy. I thought it was someone old becuase lately the unit was getting older people. But to my suprise I saw his black short curly hair. Instantly I knew it wasn't someone old but someone my age! Butterflies flew all over my stomach and my heart pumped. I wondered if I could pass by ever so quickly to just get a glance at him to see what he looks like. So I walked and I turned my head to him and he looked up at me from his chair that he sat it. It was 3 seconds, a fast glance, but it felt like he saw the inside of my soul. I don't know what he saw (he says he saw a cute girl) but I saw a cute guy that I knew I had a crush on. I ran back into the corner and was afraid because he saw me. I ran to my friend Kourtney in the dayroom and I told her there was a cute guy. We both ran to the corner and sneakily spied on him as the staff checked him in and got him adjusted. I saaw him look once more only catching his gaze only to be shoo'ed away by a wonderful woman named Rochelle. I later introduceed myself and found out his name was Jondy, he was very quiet and kept to himself. It didn't really bother me I thought he was cute and cool.</p> 

<p> It was July in the hospital and everyone was excited for the 4th because we all thought we would get good food and a chance to see fireworks outside of the unit. Boy were we wrong. But it did have a good reason to be like that because that was the day we knew we were meant for each other. We sat in the back of the dayroom by the window. Everyone in the unit knew I had a huge crush on him and my friend Edward would tease me about it. But Jondy didn't mind, maybe he liked me as a person at this point? It was dark and late. the lights were off and people were watching the fire works on the tv but me and Jondy faced the window and saw fireworks from outside. I remember the conversation to intensley. We talked about anything, anime, music, video games, things we wanted to do, and even about hanging out when we got out. those fireworks brought us together figuratively and litrerally since we were shoulder to shoulder just looking through a barracaded window as the lights and boom of the fireworks went off in different angles. We stared at each other for a good minute and smiled. I was so shy that he would think i'm ugly but I kept hoping that he liked me back because I really really liked him. Everything we talked about made me want to get to know him more and be with him. To me he's amazing. </p>

     <h3> Our dates </h3>
On July 18th 2020, he came over to my grandmother's house and we spent the whole day together. We went to the mall and I bought him a fallout bobble head and got myself another art book but this time I made my own stickers. I wanted to spoil him. He wanted to get me ice cream but I feel bad because I kept avoiding it because he only had $14 and what if he needed it later? Plus Spending money on me? No one I ever liked has ever done that. Ice cream did sound really good that day too.
